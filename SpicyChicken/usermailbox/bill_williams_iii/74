El Paso Model 8/28

FYI -

The CARP for 8/28 was not flat, which wouldn't bother me so much if A) Bert hadn't told me it was the one thing that was actually flat for the day, and B) Craig hadn't written "Variance explained" on the print-out. Explained variances do not consist of deals entered at the wrong price - i.e. the lending purchase from El Paso that we've been entering day-ahead and reducing the price real time for the past month. Because we left this price at $58 and didn't reduce it to the $2 service fee, the STWBOM and STSW books each lost approx. $22,000 in today's DPR.

I know yesterday was messy and you weren't left with a lot to go on; but this is one pretty standard practice that shouldn't be overlooked. Now don't get defensive - I'm just reminding you.

Thanks,
Kate
