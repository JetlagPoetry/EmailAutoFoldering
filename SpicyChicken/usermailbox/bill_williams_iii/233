Mike -

You should now have access to Enpower (Deal Entry, Deal Scheduling, Position Manager) and the West Power Fundamentals website; and you should have access to the Lotus Notes discussion database by early next week. Please let me know if you have any trouble using these applications or getting into the computer drives you need.

Thanks,
Kate
