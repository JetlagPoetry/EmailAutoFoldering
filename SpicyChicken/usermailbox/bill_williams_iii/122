The following appointments have been made for your meetings in Portland.  FYI--Murray O'Neil and Jake Thomas are out of the office this week and will be unable to meet with you.  Murray spends a lot of time in Houston and you might be able to schedule a meeting with him there.  Mollie can help you make other arrangements for you to meet with Jake.  Let me know if you have any questions or need any further assistance.
