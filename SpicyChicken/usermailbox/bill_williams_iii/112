The lower-of-bid or proxy cost rule only applies during System Emergencies.  The rest of the time the ISO uses your bid, assuming you have submitted one.  This so-called improvement only makes things worse because during System Emergencies you cannot bid above the proxy price because the software will default to proxy prices if your bid exceeds the proxy price.
