We have checked out with our counterparties according to our numbers, but MPC claims they have done their control area checkouts and they stick by their numbers.  There is a grey line here because the MW's that we are missing on those 5 days are actually 'in favor' of the counterparty who we sold to, so it may be that they had a discrepancy, but did not pipe up.
None-the-less, if I 'adjust our system accordingly' (meaning, put the trades in or increase the # of MW's), we'll have to hear from those counterparties.  I'm planning on telling them that the control area checkouts have been done and that they need to check their control area numbers.  I think Sandy at MPC will be willing to support us if our sale counterparties want proof.

Let me know if you have any other thoughts.

Thanks to Kate for all her help.
