Traders-

  After speaking with Risk and recognizing many inconsistencies in the way that the following deals were done, I have made the following changes that will affect your books:

 There will be no deals on the ST W Hourly books.
 ST NW will show only PGE purchase deal # 529161.1 (offset by SWAP between ST NW and LT NW).
 All other deals (421598.1, 530654.1, 530653.1, 530690.1, 530716.1, and 530689.1) have been changed to the LT NW book.

I hope this will make things easier.

  Virginia
