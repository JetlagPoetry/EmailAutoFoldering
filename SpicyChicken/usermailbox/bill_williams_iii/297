Group,

Recently there have been complaints regarding chew in the kitchen sink, chew scattered around the edge of garbage cans, and chew spit cups left on desks. Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products, we are the most visible. The relaxed atmosphere of the group is a priviledge and I expect each person in the group to be responsible for the appearance of our desk and the perception of our desk by others on the floor. Leaving chew spit cups on other desks or throwing chew in the sink is unacceptable. It is a simple thing.

Thanks,
Bill
