Bill,

Not sure if this is impacting us now, but I'm sure it will in the future!  =
Currently only the LCA has the adjust function capability, and only until 1=
.7 implementation will the PSE's have the capability to Adjust.  Until then=
, I believe we need the LCA's to co-operate with the PSE's, otherwise this =
will create unwanted workload to your group and others alike. Please give m=
e some feedback.  Not sure if you've been added to the discussion email lis=
