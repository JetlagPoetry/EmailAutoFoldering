Good Afternoon,

With the go-live date for FSP/VMS still in question, we have decided that we will build interim solution for CAPS.  There will be a new button added to the main menu of caps called "Upload RT EOL".  This new function will prompt the user to input a date & an hour.  The new function will then select west-hourly, EOL, SC trades from Enpower for the date & hour selected & insert the rows in CAPS.

Please let me know immediately if anyone has any concerns or questions, we are starting on this work ASAP.

Thanks,  Poston
