please see below in Red for answers to your questions.
In addition to the items I sent you for WHOURLY, settlements advised there are three additional items we need to take:
1. BPA transmission actualization to invoicing, amount =+$12,896 => deal number unknown at this moment.  Settlements is looking it up.  Would you want me to take this or do you want Settlements to find out the deal number first? 
2. price change for deal#479827.1 after liquidated, amount = +$1,625
3. deal added (#556989.1) after flow date passed, amount = +$11,375

Please advise if you have any questions.
