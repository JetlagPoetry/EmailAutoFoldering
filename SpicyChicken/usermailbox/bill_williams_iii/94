Hey everyone,

I know this is late notice and all (especially since last week was my last day), but anyhow please stop by VQ after work tomorrow evening for a few drinks. Since I'm unemployed now I'll be there a bit early to reserve a table of course. So I hope to see everyone there. Take it easy.

CRystal
