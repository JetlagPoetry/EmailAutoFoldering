Pete -

David Porter has recently moved from the West Hourly Trading group into Pre-Scheduling. He no longer needs Schedule Crawler notification. Could you please remove him from the instant message dispatch as well as the e-mail distribution list. 

Thanks for your help with this; and please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate Symes
