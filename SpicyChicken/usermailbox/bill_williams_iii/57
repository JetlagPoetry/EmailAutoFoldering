Hi Kate - Lisa is out today.  I have added the users to the appropriate groups which should give them access to the required databases.  I show that their notes id's have alread been created - I will go ahead and drop the id's into the H:\notes4\data directories of the respective users.  The passwords have been set to changeyourpassword - you may need to contact a floor tech to install notes on the user's machines and install the id required for accessing the databases.

Salman.
