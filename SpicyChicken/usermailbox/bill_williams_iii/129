In the southwest....

STWBOM and STSW are each 25 mw short on peak at Palo. Day-ahead price is $58. Please purchase to cover these positions under the appropriate desk, and sell back to El Paso at $0. Reduce the purchase prices in the following deals to $2 to cover the lending fee:

750007 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $58

750014 - STSW buys EPE
	 On Peak/PV
	 25 mw @ $58

In California....

STWBOM and STCA will each be short 25 mw on peak at SP15. Day-ahead price is $49.79. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
