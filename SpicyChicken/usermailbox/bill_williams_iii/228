Group,

Delano suffered a unit outage late this afternoon.  They are prescheduled at 45mw through HE22 this evening (Thursday, 8/16), 30mw HE23-24, and then 45mw all day Friday.  Please replace 25mw, SP15, through HE22 this evening, 10mw HE23-24, and then 25mw HE1-24 on Friday, 8/17.  According to Delano they should be back up and running HE1 on Saturday.

Thanks for your help.

Stan
