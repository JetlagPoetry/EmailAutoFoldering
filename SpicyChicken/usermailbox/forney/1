Hello --

It's that time of year again.  The mid-year PRC will be starting soon.  I have yet to get the official documentation from the A/A program so if you can do the following for me I'd appreciate it.

Please:

1.) Let me know who your immediate supervisor is. Name, phone, etc.
2.) Let me know whether you are still being represented by me...the only way you wouldn't be is if you were promoted to associate at year-end
3.) Let me know what you've been up to by giving me a few paragraphs on:
What you're currently doing -- responsibilities, highlights, specific deals or actions
What you've been doing since year-end (I would assume it's the same but some people may have rotated, etc.)
Then please list at least two people I can call to follow-up...please provide their phone numbers.


Thanks and I will be setting up appointments during late May.

Jon
