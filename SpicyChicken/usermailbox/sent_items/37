Group,
We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports. If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS. After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report. If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours. Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually. Once all the finals are in the load zones and int. interchanges, you should be able to create the final report. Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Bill
