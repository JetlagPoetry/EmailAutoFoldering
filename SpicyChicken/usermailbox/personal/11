I completely forgot about your trip to Vegas. I bet you didn't! Ha ha. Anyhow, I'm bummed that you are going to gone thursday and we won't be able to hang out at the Happy Hour. You'll be having a blast in Vegas though, so no biggie. Anyhow, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Maybe we can go get a beer after work tomorrow night if you don't leave too early. If not, there will be much beer to drink when you get back into town next week.
