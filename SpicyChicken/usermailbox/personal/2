Hey Bill (or do you prefer William Williams the 3rd),

What's up?  I bet you didn't think I'd e-mail you.
Don't worry, I have nothing against players.  Just
kidding...

I hope you had a good time at the show last weekend.
Maktub were pretty cool.  I know they play around
Seattle frequently so I'll check them out again
sometime.  Maybe you'll luck out and they'll come to
Portland soon.  I'm sure you have a decent music scene
in Portland so you always have other options.  I've
found that you can find some really cool little bands
or musicians in the most random little bars and
restaurants.

I hope all is well in Portland at the moment.  Seattle
has been pretty sunny and warm so I can't complain.
I'm totally looking forward to summer.  There will be
something to do every weekend.  Thank god.  Time to
start taking all my "sick" days!

Have a good day.  Don't work too hard.   If you do,
make sure you play harder to make up for it.

Talk to you later.
Colleen (the first)
