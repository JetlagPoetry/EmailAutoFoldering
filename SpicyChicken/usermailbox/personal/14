Good morning. I'm glad to hear that you are having a better day today. Me, too so far. Yeah, I stayed last night until like 7:45 and finished up that stuff with Mike Etringer. So today should be a bit more chill for me which is awesome. Anyhow, I hope nothing blows up over there for you. Maybe we can go to get some coffee later or something. Did you end up going out last night for some beers? I watched Alli McBeal and ate dinner. It was pretty exciting.
