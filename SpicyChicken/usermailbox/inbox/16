This message is only relevant for those going to UBS.

When exporting your EMAIL messages listed in the instructions or via the Outlook Export utility, attachments WILL NOT BE SAVED!
There will be a better solution to exporting your Email messages and all your attachments emailed later today.

Thank you,
John Oh
