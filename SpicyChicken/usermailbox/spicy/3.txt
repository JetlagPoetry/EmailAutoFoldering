Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline.  I am expecting to pay something in the $3,000 to $5,000 range.  I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done.  It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding.  If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify.

Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release.  If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities.  Hopefully things will go smoothly.
