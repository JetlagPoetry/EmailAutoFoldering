The World Trade Center has made arrangements with Bally Total Fitness to offer discounts to WTC tenants. The current promotion includes 2 weeks of free visits and an 8-day guest pass. If you are interested in taking advantage of this offer, please visit the Security Desk at 1-WTC.

 

Also, if you are interested in joining a membership facility and would like more information about the Enron's Fitness Reimbursement Program, or if you have any questions about the promotion with Bally Total Fitness, please let me know!

Thanks,
Grace
