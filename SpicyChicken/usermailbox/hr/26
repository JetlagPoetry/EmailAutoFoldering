Hello all! 

FYI: There are still a few spaces left for the the "Electric System Operation for the Non-Engineer" course on Friday/Saturday. Those who have attended in the past have given the course great reviews, so if you are interested in learning more about system operations, sign up now! Tuesday (tomorrow) is the deadline! If you have already signed up but will be unable to attend, please let me know ASAP.

Course info: For more detailed information about the course, please see the bottom of this e-mail. Class is scheduled to begin at 8:30am on both days. Breakfast, lunch and morning/afternoon snacks will be provided. Confirmation detail will be sent to participants on Wednesday. 

Thanks!
Grace
