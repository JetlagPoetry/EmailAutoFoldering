Bill: I've checked the information for the WSU Student Marketing meeting on 9/26, and it will take place at the WSU campus (so: no driving to Lacey, WA!). I have not yet heard back from the president of the organization, but will let you know the details when I find out what they are. The meeting begins at 7:00pm on the 26th--drive down that morning? I'll follow-up with you later.

-Grace
